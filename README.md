# PHM
###Photon Vector Math Library###

PHM is a templated vector math library that supports glsl-style syntax.

It is designed primarily with graphics applications in mind, so it ensures data is aligned in a graphics-friendly manner, and comes with functions and features that should feel familiar to any graphics programmer. It supports swizzle for vectors of sizes one to four.

However, it can be used for general mathematical applications, supporting arbitrary sized vectors and matrices, in column or row major, with numerous operations and functions useful for linear algebra.
